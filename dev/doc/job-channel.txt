Job input from a buffer ~
							*in_io-buffer*
A special mode is when "in_top" is set to zero and "in_bot" is not set: Every
time a line is added to the buffer, the last-but-one line will be sent to the
job stdin.  This allows for editing the last line and sending it when pressing
Enter.

	let job = job_start('cat', {'in_io': 'buffer', 'in_name': 'cmd_in_io', 'out_io':'buffer','out_name': 'out_io', 'in_top':0})
    call job_stop(job)
    e cmd_in_io
    e out_io

10. Starting a job without a channel			*job-start-nochannel*
To start another process without creating a channel: >
    let job = job_start(command,
	\ {"in_io": "null", "out_io": "null", "err_io": "null"})
This starts {command} in the background, Vim does not wait for it to finish.


12. Job options						*job-options*
"env": dict		environment variables for the new process
"cwd": "/path/to/dir"	current working directory for the new process;
			if the directory does not exist an error is given
