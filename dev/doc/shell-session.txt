reptyr use <sys/ptrace.h>
cygwin has no <sys/ptrace.h>

Security considerations
Setting ptrace_scope as 0 is not recommended.
A reasonable approach is to set ptrace_scope to 2 and then allow reptyr to use ptrace:
echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
sudo setcap CAP_SYS_PTRACE+pe /usr/bin/reptyr
