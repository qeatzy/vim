'shellslash'
tempname()					*tempname()* *temp-file-name*
<		For Unix, the file will be in a private directory |tempfile|.
		For MS-Windows forward slashes are used when the 'shellslash'
		option is set or when 'shellcmdflag' starts with '-'.

writefile({object}, {fname} [, {flags}])
		When {flags} contains "s" then fsync() is called after writing
		the file.  This flushes the file to disk, if possible.  This
		takes more time but avoids losing the file if the system
		crashes.
		An existing file is overwritten, if possible.
		When the write fails -1 is returned, otherwise 0.
