Usually, MANPAGER expects nroff-processed text as its input, e.g., N^HNA^HAM^HME^HE for NAME (bold), and _^Hg_^Hi_^Ht for git (underlined), where ^H is <C-H>.

On the other hand, according to the screenshot, those byte strings are somehow converted into the escape sequences starting with ^[[1m and ^[[4m, respectively, where ^[ is <Esc>. The former renders characters in bold, and the latter does them underlined.

@DennisWilliamson See the changelog by :help version8.txt. --not-a-term option itself was added in 7.4.1419 and its behavior was changed to also suppress the Reading from stdin... message in 8.0.1308. (By the way, the N files to edit message is also be suppressed from 8.1.1258) â€“ ynn Oct 20 at 15:13
