One of reasons that I don't like balloon is that doesn't allow highlight.

I have added a detailed design in patch 8.1.1329. Feel free to comment.

A small group of users would like floating windows for editing, toplevel
GUI windows, non-tiling window layout, etc.  I think this is what Neovim
is intending to provide, and have popup windows as a side effect.

Implementation has started and the design is now in runtime/doc/popup.txt.
Let's close this issue now. If you have ideas or comments regarding popup windows, please open a new issue.

I recently fixed the background color (there is a screendump test for
that).

 Thanks, since the popup window is local to the current tabpage, is the
 winid an unique id across tabpages ?
Yes, ":help window-ID".
Popup windows can also be global, they hang around when going through
tab pages.
 how to change highlighting ??
Use text properties.
  https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/4063#issuecomment-497619429
Whether you use syntax highlighting or text properties in a popup window
is completely up to you.  You can also mix them.

I played around with this a bit and realized that using setwinvar() for
'syntax' does not work, because setwinvar() blocks autocommands, and
setting up syntax highligting needs autocommands.  So the best way is:
	call win_execute(winid, "set syntax=python")
I added test for that.  And fixed that an unintended side effect was
that 'buftype' got reset.

@Yggdroot you can implement with filter. This is confirm dialog when open new buffer.

someone would write a readline library for popupsï¼Ÿ
  https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/4063#issuecomment-502391905
@prabirshrestha , Scroll your content by
    call win_execute("normal \<c-e>")
    call win_execute("normal \<c-y>")
?? and bind them to <m-e> and <m-y>, you will be able to scroll your popup window without focsing.

    Are we able to have a foating fuzzyfinder (FZF) or grep. Can't seem to figure it out.
Well the infrastructure for that is available. Needs a plugin writer for that, if there is none available yet.
  https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/4063#issuecomment-535039624
    Popup windows do not have a cursor. When you open a popup window, the focus and
the cursor stay on the window it was called from. The way to interact with a popup
window is through popup-filter.

    Why are you trying to run a terminal window in a popup window?  It smells like
you want to show the result of some external command.  Using channel functions
for this is probably a better solution.  Or use a hidden terminal window and
copy the text to the popup window (the terminal debugger does this).
